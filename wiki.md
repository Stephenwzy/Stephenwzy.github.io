**Web GIS** is a *pattern*, or *architectural* approach, for implementing a modern GIS. 


## Section 1
Web GIS can be implemented in the cloud (using ArcGIS Online), on-premises (using ArcGIS Server), or more typically as a hybrid combination, leveraging the best of both worlds.
Web GIS isn’t new, in fact it’s been evolving for a long while. But we’ve reached, actually passed, a tipping point where innovation in GIS and related technologies have made Web GIS not only possible, but essential.


## Components of a Web GIS application
There are five essential elements in every web GIS application:

1. A web application
2. Digital basemaps
3. Operational layers
4. Tasks and tools in the web GIS application
5. One or more geodatabases
 

## Potential of Web GIS
Web GIS provides many more opportunities to provide broader access to your authoritative GIS data, enabling you to move your system of record to a system of engagement that facilitates everything from self-service mapping to making better decisions. It makes GIS more accessible, more affordable, and more pervasive. It amplifies the value of GIS, and the role of GIS professionals.
