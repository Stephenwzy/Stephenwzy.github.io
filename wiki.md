## Definition
**Web GIS** is a *pattern*, or *architectural* approach, for implementing a modern GIS. Web GIS is a technology that is used to display and analyze spatial data on the Internet. It combines the advantages of both the Internet and GIS. It offers public a new means to access spatial information without owning expensive GIS software.


## Introduction
Web GIS can be implemented in the cloud (using ArcGIS Online), on-premises (using ArcGIS Server), or more typically as a hybrid combination, leveraging the best of both worlds.
Web GIS isn’t new, in fact it’s been evolving for a long while. But we’ve reached, actually passed, a tipping point where innovation in GIS and related technologies have made Web GIS not only possible, but essential.


## Components of a Web GIS application
There are some essential elements in Web GIS:

1. The server has a URL so that clients can find it on the web.
2. The client relies on HTTP specifications to send requests to the server.
3. The server performs the requested GIS operations and sends responses to the client via HTTP.
4. The format of the response sent to the client can be in many formats, such as HTML, binary image, XML (Extensible Markup Language), or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

## Potential of Web GIS
Web GIS provides many more opportunities to provide broader access to your authoritative GIS data, enabling you to move your system of record to a system of engagement that facilitates everything from self-service mapping to making better decisions. It makes GIS more accessible, more affordable, and more pervasive. It amplifies the value of GIS, and the role of GIS professionals.
